title: Test with images
---

This is a test with some inline images like ![Image of a cat](./cat.jpg) or via the html to change the width <img src="./cat.jpg" style="width:40px"/> and <img src="./cat.jpg" width="40"/>, both the width and height <img src="./cat.jpg" height="60" width="60"/> or one alone in a paragraph like:

![Image of a cat](./cat.jpg)

Here I change the width of the current next image to be full width:

<img src="./cat.jpg" class="w-full"/>

See that you can also use custom html like <b>this one</b>.
